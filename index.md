I am a recent graduate of the University of Connecticut Honors program with a degree in Applied Mathematics. Currently, I'm working in the [Churchill Lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-churchill-lab) at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine while I decide what I would like to study in grad school. During my time at the University of Connecticut, I completed my undergraduate thesis at the UConn Health Center's Center for Quantitative Medicine with the [Computational Systems Medicine Team](http://veraliconalab.org/). In my down time I love all outdoor adventures in Acadia National Park and singing for my cats :smiley_cat:.
